# Covetous Circle [jQuery Game]
FORKED FROM BRIAN-09
This is a jQuery game I've created for a project. It's about a green circle that you control who wants all the gold for themself. You have to avoid obstacles (indicated as red squares that fade in) while trying to get as much score as possible. There's power ups that'll help you, but be careful not to pick up a dupe, which will cause a hallucination/debuff. It's a lot of RNG, which keeps every game feeling a bit more new than the last, but can also make it challenging at times. Good luck!
